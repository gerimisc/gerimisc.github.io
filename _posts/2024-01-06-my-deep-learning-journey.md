## Limitations and Why They Matter
```
A model cannot be created without data.
A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.
This learning approach only creates predictions, not recommended actions.
It's not enough to just have examples of input data; we need labels for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren't enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats).
