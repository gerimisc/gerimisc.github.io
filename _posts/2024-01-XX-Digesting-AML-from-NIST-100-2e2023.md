# AML

## Key Points
```
A taxonomy of the most widely studied and effective attacks in AML, including:
- evasion, poisoning, and privacy attacks for PredAI systems,
- evasion, poisoning, privacy, and abuse/misuse attacks for GenAI systems;
â€“ attacks against all viable learning methods (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised,
```

### Training vs Deployment
#### Training Stage Attacks:
Attacker controls parts of training data, labels, model parameters, or ML algorithm code.
Leads to various types of poisoning attacks.
#### Deployment Stage Attacks:
ML model is already trained.
Adversary can conduct evasion attacks causing integrity violations and altering predictions.
Privacy attacks aimed at inferring sensitive information about training data or ML model.


### Multimodal models vs singular models
