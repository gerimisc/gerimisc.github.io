ActivityPub is a decentralized protocol for building social networking applications and platforms. It provides a standardized way for different applications to communicate and interact with each other, enabling users to share and interact with content across different platforms.

At its core, ActivityPub is based on the concept of "activities," which represent actions performed by users or applications. These activities can include things like creating a post, following another user, liking a post, or sending a message. Activities are represented using a JSON-based format.

One of the key features of ActivityPub is its decentralized nature. Instead of relying on a central server or platform, ActivityPub allows users to host their own instances or servers, called "federated servers." These servers can communicate with each other, allowing users on different instances to interact with each other's content.

ActivityPub also supports a variety of features to enhance privacy and security. For example, users can control the visibility of their posts and choose who can see their content. Additionally, ActivityPub supports end-to-end encryption for private messages.

In the context of your project, if you are building a bundler for Ruby, it's possible that you may want to integrate ActivityPub functionality into your application. This could involve implementing the ActivityPub protocol to enable your users to interact with social networking features or to integrate with existing ActivityPub-based platforms.
